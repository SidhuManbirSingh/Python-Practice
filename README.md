Index of Contents for test_formatted.py

Section 1: Arithmetic and Basic I/O Operations
• Demonstrates basic arithmetic (addition) and area/perimeter calculation.
• Reads user input for numbers and prints the results.

Section 2: String Slicing and Manipulation
• Introduces string slicing techniques.
• Shows examples of extracting substrings, reversing a string, and taking every 2nd character.

Section 3: Conditional Statements and Grade Calculation
• Uses if-elif-else constructs to determine and print a grade based on marks.

Section 4: Finding the Largest Number Among Three
• Takes three numerical inputs and prints the largest using conditional checks.

Section 5: Modulus Operation Example
• Shows how to check divisibility (e.g., if a number is divisible by 7).

Section 6: List and String Operations, Palindrome Check
• Collects movie names into a list.
• Checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.

Section 7: List Sorting and Reversing
• Sorts a list of grades and then creates a reversed copy of the list.

Section 8: Set Operations and Duplicate Removal
• Demonstrates how sets automatically remove duplicate elements.
• Explores mixed data types within sets.

Section 9: Looping Constructs (For and While loops)
• Provides examples of using for-loops and while-loops.
• Includes examples like counting, multiplication tables, and simple ranges.

Section 10: Summation and Factorial Calculations
• Illustrates a summation loop to add numbers up to a given value.
• Presents both recursive and iterative methods for calculating a factorial.

Section 11: List Utilities and Recursion Examples
• Defines functions to efficiently get the length of a list and print list elements.
• Contains a basic example of a recursive function.

Section 12: Working with External Libraries (Requests)
• Shows how to use the requests library to fetch exchange rate data from an API.
• Handles API response and potential errors.

Section 13: File Operations (Read, Write, Update)
• Includes examples for file I/O: writing data, reading and modifying content, and updating a file.
• Demonstrates line-by-line file reading and checking for specific words.

Section 14: Measuring Execution Time (Using time module)
• Uses the time module to measure the execution time of a sample while-loop that prints numbers.

Section 15: CSV File Operations
• Includes examples for CSV file handling using Python’s csv module.
• Contains functions that print even numbers from CSV data and count even numbers.

Section 16: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Examples
• Student Average Calculation: Defines a Student class to compute average marks.
• Bank Operations Example: Illustrates a Bank class with deposit, withdrawal, and balance methods.
• Object Attribute Manipulation: Demonstrates handling object attributes and potential exceptions.
• Encapsulation Example: Uses private attributes in an Account class.
• Inheritance Examples:

Basic inheritance with a Car class and child classes.
Inheritance with overriding, multiple inheritance, and use of class methods.
• Property and Attribute Manipulation (Person Class): Uses a property to calculate and update a percentage dynamically.
• Improved Student Class (Java-like setter approach): Provides methods for setting physics marks and automatically updating the percentage.
• Student Class with calcPercentage method: Calculates the percentage as a formatted string and updates it after modifying attributes.
